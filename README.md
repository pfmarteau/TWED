# TWED
# Time Warp Edit Distance

The Time Warp Edit Distance (TWED) is a distance measure for discrete time series matching with time 'elasticity'. In comparison to other distance measures, (e.g. DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) or LCS (Longest Common Subsequence Problem)), TWED is a metric. Its computational time complexity is O(n^2), but can be drastically reduced in some specific situation by using a corridor to reduce the search space. Its memory space complexity can be reduced to O(n). It was first proposed in [1].

**TWED_c** directory contains a C biding of TWED, nearly two order of magnitude faster that **twed.py** implementation.
To install the C version, correct accordingly to your OS and python installation, the paths for including **Python.h** and **arrayobject.h** in **TWED.C**, then execute inside **TWED_c** subdirectory:

$ python3 setup.py install --user

and to test:
$ python3 test.py
